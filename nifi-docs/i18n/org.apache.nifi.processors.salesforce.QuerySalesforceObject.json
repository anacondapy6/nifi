{"capabilityDescription":{"en":"Retrieves records from a Salesforce sObject. Users can add arbitrary filter conditions by setting the 'Custom WHERE Condition' property. The processor can also run a custom query, although record processing is not supported in that case. Supports incremental retrieval: users can define a field in the 'Age Field' property that will be used to determine when the record was created. When this property is set the processor will retrieve new records. Incremental loading and record-based processing are only supported in property-based queries. It's also possible to define an initial cutoff value for the age, filtering out all older records even for the first run. In case of 'Property Based Query' this processor should run on the Primary Node only. FlowFile attribute 'record.count' indicates how many records were retrieved and written to the output. The processor can accept an optional input FlowFile and reference the FlowFile attributes in the query.","zh":"Retrieves records from a Salesforce sObject.
