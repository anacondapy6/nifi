{"capabilityDescription":{"en":"Provides an ADLSCredentialsService that can be used to dynamically select another ADLSCredentialsService. This service requires an attribute named 'adls.credentials.name' to be passed in, and will throw an exception if the attribute is missing.

This will allow multiple ADLSCredentialsServices to be defined and registered, and then selected dynamically at runtime by tagging flow files with the appropriate 'adls.credentials.name' attribute.","zh":"Provides an ADLSCredentialsService that can be used to dynamically select another ADLSCredentialsService.
